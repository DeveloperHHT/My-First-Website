  <p class="w3-opacity"><i>WHO IS VAN GOGH ?</i></p>
The Dutch art Impressionist painter Van Gogh's full name is Vincent Willem van Gogh. There are many curious questions about Van Gogh, one of the most well-known and influential figures in the history of Western art. Why did Van Gogh cut off his ear? Was Van Gogh schizophrenic? Did Van Gogh commit suicide or kill himself? Here's what to know about Van Gogh for the answer to all these questions and more...
Van Gogh, who produced about 2,100 paintings and drawings in just over 10 years, including 860 oil paintings, did most of them in the last two years of his life. These include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits. it is distinguished by its bold colors, which are considered the foundations of modern Art, and its vivid, impulsive and expressive brushstrokes.
Born on March 30, 1853, the painter was the child of an upper-middle-class family. As a child, he was serious, quiet and respectful. In his youth, he worked as an art dealer, but after being sent to London, he became depressed. After returning to religion, he worked as a Protestant missionary in the south of Belgium. After his health deteriorated and he lived in solitude, he returned to his parents and began painting in 1881.
<p>HE PAINTED WITH MONEY FROM HIS BROTHER</p>
He was financially supported by his younger brother Theo, and the two corresponded by letter for years. Theo van Gogh, an art dealer, provided his brother with both financial and emotional support, as well as his brother's access to influential figures in the art world of the era.
His early works, consisting mostly of still lifes and depictions of working peasants, do not see the vivid colors that are the hallmark of his later works. In Paris, where he moved in 1886, he met members of the avant-garde who reacted against impressionist sensibility, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin. As his work developed, he took a new approach to still lifes and local landscapes. He began to use brighter colors in his paintings and developed a distinctive style that he would later Master in Arles, where he remained in the south of France in 1888. During this period, olive trees, cypresses, wheat fields and sunflowers also began to be the subject of his canvases.
<p>WHY DID VAN GOGH CUT OFF HIS EAR?</p>
The question everyone is wondering: why did Van Gogh cut off his ear? After a nervous breakdown, he hurt himself, not anyone else. The painter, who had psychological problems, neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank excessive alcohol, although he was concerned about his mental health. His friendship with Gauguin ended as a result of him cutting off his path with a razor and injuring part of his left ear as a result of a temper tantrum. It is known that the artist gave his ear, which he cut, to a prostitute.
<p>HE KILLED HIMSELF</p>
After leaving the hospital of his own accord, the painter moved to Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, and began to be treated by the doctor Paul Gachet, who practiced homeopathy. His depression continued and he shot himself in the chest with a gun on July 27, 1890. He died two days later on July 29, 1890, of his wounds.
<p>POSTHUMOUS FAME</p>
Van Gogh, who had failed during his time, was considered crazy. The painter, who rose to fame after his suicide, was featured in the public image as a typical misunderstood genius, a painter who showed "discourses that madness and creativity coexist."
20. Van Gogh, whose reputation began to grow at the turn of the century and which achieved widespread critical, commercial and popular success over the following years, is remembered as an important but sad painter whose troubled personality symbolizes the romantic, tormented ideal of the artist.
